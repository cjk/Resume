## Background

I'm a software developer with an interest in user-facing products and services. I enjoy building and prototyping things quickly. My ideal is to execute new ideas while working on a variety of components and technologies at the same time -- apps, sites, and services.

I like experimenting with new languages and frameworks. Lately I've been using JavaScript, CoffeeScript, and Python, but I have experience in Objective-C, C#, Java, ActionScript, Ruby, C/C++, and SQL. My recent project focus has been building content navigation and video playback applications for living room devices, using web technologies with data-driven server interactions.

I strive to be an independent worker and capable leader. When I have free time, I enjoy family, playing guitar, cooking, taking my dogs hiking, and reading fiction.
